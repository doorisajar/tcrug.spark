# tcrug.spark

I gave this talk on `sparklyr` at the 2018-09-20 meeting of the Twin Cities R Users' Group. 

I gave an intro from the slides in `inst/pres` first, then ran through the demo script `inst/scripts/aws_demo.R` on a live AWS EMR cluster. 

I'll update this README with a link to the talk video once that's up!
